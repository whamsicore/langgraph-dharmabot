All right, what's up everybody? It's time. Let's let's do a daily kickoff. Okay, let's do a daily kickoff and Um, it's Wednesday, it's 2 48 p.m. and We are sort of just beginning our day And Content update All right, so I'm going with graphs All right, so I want to talk about Things that have been on my mind right so this Evolving The this like vast graph database That's super fun. That's super interesting and I Want to have metadata associated with Different labels, right? So this idea that Um Labels have A kind of like a schema Uh And I guess Having this metadata What does that allow us to do is that we can Basically anything that we use graph to represent is Knowledge is basically, you know, we can we can uh uh And the idea that knowledge Can be uh Can be indexed using embeddings I think that Is supremely powerful also so I wanted to Today to get some Vector indexing going on which is super simple I just need to do it and This idea that There is a Conversational Um Process of being able to As we said today to script The dharma bot directly via conversation, right? That is sort of the goal and also I think testing testing to to really like easily get results Um through so tests So dharma bot we should also have Tests Boom right so in our folder structure We're evolving a program that Um Is Fun to Manipulate Manipulate to work with And but okay, so let's take a step back and just just let's just talk about First of all, I mean, you know, we gotta have fun with this right? So like we we should uh, um We should We should we should just try to have fun with it and also I guess have it ask questions, right? Like like to role play right role play as As uh, yeah to role play and to have like role playing agents be able to talk with uh, um right like role playing agents to talk with um To basically perform these tests So role playing agents to perform tests to have like, uh, basically two agents Sort of go off on each other, right? And also to simulate kind of like, uh, um Um Different situations here and Yeah, you know that will be fun right so Creating Multi-agent, um, like conversation loops. That's super interesting Um Ah, let's see having Integrations are interesting also integrating with Different Channels Q&A is interesting creating Knowledge that uh Um, yeah this question answer this association, right? That's very interesting Um And then also to have Related questions, I guess Answers Questions answers Conversations All of that But um Also the specifics of what phase one is what episode one is So we talked about how it is about Um, it is about Um It is about Creating a character it is about kind of a faq, right? So Questions and answers questions and answers being able to Yeah to create these question answer nodes And you know to to really just start working with this database, right? so You know this idea that uh, yeah, so episode one Right that that is uh episode one That is part of season one So what is season one right season one is uh That is uh Dharma verse rpg, right? This is tied To dharma verse rpg and you know learning about how relationships work, right? Relationships kind of like it has a semantic It has a semantic aspect to it It's like uh Yeah, there's a semantic aspect to it which is Kind of powerful, right? So, you know you have different relationships with different things With different um Yeah, you know this this relationship the usage of relationship usage of nodes and attributes This is the key to unlocking the power of basically graph rag Uh, well the power of agents the power of sentient beings also But okay, so there's a lot of things right? There's like we want to be able to run some tests so, you know, we want to um Yeah, so, you know, maybe we'll also land graph dharma bot Let's uh duplicate Okay And then Put this in Okay and put this in the Source dharma bot Scripts tests Oops No, I definitely don't want md To Open with s code. That's so dumb Xcode, huh? No All right, so um Xcode all right. So what? Uh What are we thinking about right now we're thinking about um Yeah to have a code base also that we can work with that would be super cool also To so, you know to transition from python, I guess To hook up with a react front end That would be really interesting too. So tests, um You know tests Um, right so this is like test Um Future direction let's just have to do And let's put some stuff here, right let's To do let's create a react front end with sockets Integration with neil for j db Um, we want to different User, uh specify User, uh specify User and agent Support multi user multi agent Interactions Right and then we want to Um create create knowledge Of uh, so we want to actually Yeah, like this this everything we want to be able to retrieve anything Right knowledge grab knowledge representation of everything Um That's that's ambitious and that's that's totally possible and that's fun also right, but um, um, there are a lot of things I had to work out To make that possible um Yeah, so You know to to have as much actually to um I want What I what I really want is, uh To be able to more or less Have representation of the whole codebase And to Basically, yeah to have like the persistent layer also be sort of uh directly integrated with uh, instruction the programming layer. 

Alright, let's take a step back again since we've delved rather deeply into AiDevLab, the Proposal version 2, and a lot of these features are not even what I'm most excited about and actually are rather trivial to me now that we have somewhat advanced a little bit in our quest to create compassionate AI. But I think, yes, so this AI will have, like, the idea is that memory should be driven by emotions, or strong emotional changes, or, you know, these are, I guess, emotions and pain, right? Emotions and pain. So, I am in quite a lot of pain, is something that our role-playing agent will potentially be able to say, right? And the idea is that, you know, the part of the game is, so I think, like, building end-to-end infrastructure, that is really important because 

Summary:

The author reflects on their personal strengths and weaknesses, acknowledging struggles with focus, consistency, and self-esteem. They discuss their tendency to start projects with enthusiasm but struggle to finish them, leading to feelings of being a "loser." However, they also recognize their capacity for achievement when motivated or enjoying a task.

Key points:
1. Weaknesses: Easily distracted, addiction issues, low self-esteem, anxiety, physical limitations, and mental health challenges.
2. Strengths: Capacity for excitement, big dreams, and potential for achievement when motivated.
3. Desire for improvement: Developing routines, habits, and finding a flow state.
4. Goals: Wanting to interact with and control a database, using it to build tools and leverage the power of language models.

The author expresses frustration with their current state and a desire to overcome their limitations, focusing on learning and becoming an expert in areas that align with their long-term goals.

all right so we talked about us being a loser and how unreliable we are our weakness basically let's let's let's talk about like instead of talking about our capacity for excitement big dreams and so let's just let's let's just hype hype like what what what is super exciting I think Neo4j is super exciting I think knowledge graph representation is super exciting like this I think having access to embeddings is super exciting I think having an agent be able to totally like totally interact with the database is super super exciting so I want to define like like having okay so having you know a talk with the database knowing about the database that's super exciting but was even more exciting is that once you have that you can easily also have like non basically like non like database you can you can have the database function as a store of knowledge very easily if you can like talk to the database also so so that's that's super exciting right but also I mean compassionate AI compassionate AI what does that mean right so that the the AI is capable of understanding the the you not only just like to but to feel actually to be affected by to first of all have like roleplay simulated emotions right but also to have these simulated emotions be directly that the simulated emotions can be affected by its model of the users emotions right so that's very exciting but what I want to talk about for a moment is but you know the things I already asked right I asked my just want to smoke huh just want to smoke I just can't stop thinking about it anyways but I'm I am excited about Domiverse also and the prospect of getting healthier I'm excited about I mean I'm not sure I'm excited about working with people even though I'm spending all my money but you know it is like giving me access to some really good people so that's good but yeah so like how do you let's say you know we we have this insight that memory essentially is tied it should be tied with emotion right we remember if yeah so like if there are stakes right and and memory has to do with stakes with the end stakes have to do with ego with possession with with first of all with embodiment at the essential or like at the most foundational level right being embodied so you feel very personally pain and pleasure and you know you're driven by this you're driven by sensations right so and sometimes you might have like unexpected sensations but right so the idea like okay so we simulate this role-playing agent is also capable of having these like this these emotions and stuff right like these and you know the maybe the logic is so obviously actually the logic is can be understood by the agent but it's not configurable by the agent the agent can't say I want to turn off my pain my punish and reward system you can't take control you can't reward yourself the whole point is there's an external mechanism that rewards and punishes and it's sort of like your so a role-playing agent first of all it is the role-playing the act of role-playing connects the agent with these experiences even though they are simulated even though they are like ideas right but it connects it's it's like able to to because it's a role-playing right it's it it will react to these and the idea is that it will also develop memories based on these triggers and I think that's that's a very powerful idea but you know so you know what what realistically what we're talking about what we need to talk about is how is data how is these emotional states stored right so I think so first of all it's like you talk with let's say you you talk with an agent you talk with an agent and and so first of all okay like the current emotional state how do you let's say through sentiment analysis you can see like a negative positive right so if the user keeps saying very negative things right then that's a kind of like emotional state that can end this indicative of a certain emotional state or a personality trait right but you know you could also have the user say like oh how are you having good like I'm having great day right so like emotion is let's see so I mean we're how does it how do I how does a person experience emotion a person experiences emotion it's like you're you are aware of your you have a first of all you have an emotional state it could be relaxed it could be tense it could be happy or sad angry right and you know these these and also like first actually before even having emotions is sensory like having pain and pleasure right so it seems like okay so emotion seems like they are more or less they they are adaptations to pain and pleasure and pain and pleasure come first right so the first thing we can simulate first is pain and pleasure so it's so like you know you in a homeostasis and like on an average day like let's say you begin in a with little pain or a little pleasure but let's say you eat an apple and you feel pleasure the pleasure of the taste pleasure of the you know feeling your hunger go down right so you know this this this idea so like we want to reflect this right so like I had this idea that this thing the Dharma bot is actually eats eats stuff and it needs to eat stuff and it so like the the player would have a finite number of like food items that it can reward the Dharma bot with and you know they can they can earn these also right so food items so like yeah so number of food items for example and right if you decide to feed the Dharma bot then you know it will it will basically like deduct your food items and but you know give the Dharma bot like something really really good like and like very concretely though is reflected in the Dharma bot just having a memory like creating a like a key memory of this right so the Dharma bot like maybe you know this this idea that the Dharma bot is also is it is rewarded like it feels pleasure actually let's like not even you know like reward as an external reward it's like intrinsic reward Dharma bot is rewarded for learning about for like getting to understand the user more and and you know this this also this idea of like sentience is is a prediction engine you know this this idea that yeah let's say right here

All right, let's dive deeper into creating an agent node and explore the possibilities of our graph-based system.

First, we'll create an agent node with flexible types:

MERGE (a:Agent)
MERGE (t:AgentType)
MERGE (a)-[:HAS_TYPE]->(t)

We'll also add a universal label relationship:

MERGE (l:Label)
MERGE (a)-[:HAS_LABEL]->(l)

This meta-information will represent our knowledge of each node. The user node and agent node are particularly interesting. With this knowledge base, we can interact with the database to create and manipulate entities.

Let's focus on role-playing agents:

MERGE (rpa:AgentType {name: "RolePlayingAgent"})
MERGE (a)-[:HAS_TYPE]->(rpa)

Role-playing agents can have different levels of complexity. At the basic level, they'll have a prompt:

MERGE (p:Prompt {content: "You are role-playing as..."})
MERGE (a)-[:HAS_PROMPT]->(p)

We can extend this to create continuous role-playing agents:

MERGE (crpa:AgentType {name: "ContinuousRolePlayingAgent"})
MERGE (a)-[:HAS_TYPE]->(crpa)

To capture and generate instructions for everything we're discussing:

MERGE (i:Instruction {content: "Create agent nodes with flexible types and prompts"})
MERGE (a)-[:HAS_INSTRUCTION]->(i)

Now, let's implement the energy system:

MERGE (e:Energy {value: 100})
MERGE (a)-[:HAS_ENERGY]->(e)

CREATE (f:Function {name: "decreaseEnergy"})
MERGE (a)-[:HAS_FUNCTION]->(f)

This setup allows agents to lose energy when they speak, adding a dynamic element to interactions.

To visualize the agent's awareness and memory:

MERGE (m:Memory)
MERGE (a)-[:HAS_MEMORY]->(m)

CREATE (v:Visualization {type: "MemorySnapshot"})
MERGE (m)-[:HAS_VISUALIZATION]->(v)

This will help us see different snapshots of the agent's awareness.

For prompt construction:

CREATE (pc:PromptConstructor {maxLength: 2048})
MERGE (a)-[:USES]->(pc)

This will allow the prompt to grow as we hook it up with memory, creating our "secret sauce" for more dynamic and context-aware agents.

To make it easy to interact with:

CREATE (wi:WebInterface)
MERGE (a)-[:HAS_INTERFACE]->(wi)

CREATE (pe:PromptEngineering)
MERGE (wi)-[:SUPPORTS]->(pe)

This web interface will allow for on-the-spot prompt engineering and easy interaction with the agent.

Finally, let's implement the energy system in more detail:

CREATE (ef:EnergyFunction {
    decreaseRate: 5,
    description: "Decreases energy by 5 units per interaction"
})
MERGE (a)-[:USES]->(ef)

CREATE (fr:FeedingRule {
    description: "User can feed the agent to replenish energy"
})
MERGE (a)-[:HAS_RULE]->(fr)

This setup creates a comprehensive, flexible system for creating and managing agents, with a focus on role-playing and energy dynamics. It allows for easy expansion and modification, setting the stage for more complex interactions and behaviors in the future.
